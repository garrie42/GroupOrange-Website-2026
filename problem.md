# The Problem
Healthcare organizations still depend heavily on fax for sharing records, referrals, and test results, which leads to delays, errors, and fragmented care.

## Why it matters
- Slow and unreliable transfers delay treatment
- Lost/unreadable pages create rework and risk
- Patients may repeat tests due to missing records
- Rural and underfunded facilities are disproportionately impacted
